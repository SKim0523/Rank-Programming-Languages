            What is C?<br /><br />
            C programming language is the oldest and most widely used of the
            three. Dennis Ritchie invented it in 1972 and then published in
            1978. Ritchie designed it for the development of a new version of
            Unix.<br />

            Up until that point, the Unix operating system used assembly
            language, which is the lowest level of programming readable by a
            computer. The invention of C revolutionized programming and
            operating systems forever. The rest, as they say, is history.<br />

            C is still a low-level programming language, which performs almost
            as efficiently as assembly code. It provides base-level access to
            memory, and it requires very little runtime support.<br />

            Despite being published 40 years ago, C is still the most widely
            used programming language of all time. Programmers still use it in
            operating systems, kernel-level software, hardware drivers, and
            applications that need to work with older code.<br />

            Most old-school programmers will suggest that C is the best
            programming language to start with because so many newer languages
            build off of it. It may also offer some security benefits because of
            its age. The pool of people using it is smaller, making it a less
            desirable target for hackers.<br /><br />

            What is C++?<br /><br />
            C++ was developed as an extension of the C programming language. It
            was created by a Ph.D. student in Denmark named Bjarne Stroustrup.
            His goal was to enhance C and add object-oriented programming
            capabilities without sacrificing speed or efficiency.<br />

            C++ is considered an intermediate-level programming language, as it
            builds upon the low-level C language but has more advanced
            capabilities.<br />

            Since the initial publication of C++ in 1985, it has become another
            extremely prolific programming language. It’s used alongside C in
            the development of operating systems but also sees use in
            high-profile server and PC software.<br />

            It is a lot easier to understand C++ if you already have a solid
            foundation in the C programming language; however, you can still
            learn C++ as your first language if you want to jump right into
            object-oriented programming.<br /><br />

            What is C++?<br /><br />
            C# (pronounced “C Sharp”) is a high-level, object-oriented
            programming language that is also built as an extension of C. It was
            developed by a team at Microsoft lead by Anders Hejlsberg in 2002.
            It is based in the .NET framework, but its backbone is still clearly
            the C language.<br />

            C# compiles into byte-code, rather than machine code. That means it
            executes on a virtual computer that translates it into machine code
            on the fly. It adds garbage collection, uninitialized variable
            checking, bound checking, and type checking capabilities to the base
            C code.<br /><br />

            C# typically sees use in internal or enterprise applications, rather
            than commercial software. It’s found in client and server
            development in the .NET framework.<br /><br />

            JAVA was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc in the
            year 1995, later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It is a simple
            programming language. Java makes writing, compiling, and debugging
            programming easy. It helps to create reusable code and modular
            programs. Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming
            language and is designed to have as few implementation dependencies
            as possible. A general-purpose programming language made for
            developers to write once run anywhere that is compiled Java code can
            run on all platforms that support Java. Java applications are
            compiled to byte code that can run on any Java Virtual Machine. The
            syntax of Java is similar to c/c++.<br /><br />

            JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is
            one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML
            and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client
            side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party
            libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine
            to execute the code on users' devices.<br /><br />

            JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language
            that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing,
            prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
            multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative
            programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs)
            for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data
            structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).<br /><br />

            The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O),
            such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice,
            the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for
            I/O.<br /><br />

            JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but
            are now core components of some servers and a variety of
            applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is
            Node.js.<br /><br />
            Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and
            respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and
            differ greatly in design.<br /><br />

            PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared toward web
            development. It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer
            Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. The PHP reference implementation is now
            produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for Personal Home
            Page, but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext
            Preprocessor.<br /><br />

            PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter
            implemented as a module, a daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface
            (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and
            executed PHP code – which may be any type of data, such as generated
            HTML or binary image data – would form the whole or part of an HTTP
            response. Various web template systems, web content management
            systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to
            orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response.
            Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the
            web context, such as standalone graphical applications and robotic
            drone control. PHP code can also be directly executed from the
            command line.<br /><br />

            The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free
            software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported
            and can be deployed on most web servers on a variety of operating
            systems and platforms.<br /><br />

            The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or
            standard until 2014, with the original implementation acting as the
            de facto standard which other implementations aimed to follow. Since
            2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.<br /><br />

            W3Techs reports that, as of January 2022, "PHP is used by 78.1% of
            all the websites whose server-side programming language we know."
            PHP version 7.4 is the most used version. Support for version 7.3
            was dropped on 6 December 2021.<br /><br />

            Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming
            language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the
            use of significant indentation.<br /><br />

            Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports
            multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly
            procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often
            described as a "batteries included" language due to its
            comprehensive standard library.<br /><br />

            Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a
            successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in
            1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced
            new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage
            collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 3.0,
            released in 2008, was a major revision that is not completely
            backward-compatible with earlier versions.<br /><br />
            Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.<br /><br />

            R is a language and environment for statistical computing and
            graphics. It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and
            environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T,
            now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be
            considered as a different implementation of S. There are some
            important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered
            under R.<br /><br />

            R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear
            modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis,
            classification, clustering, …) and graphical techniques, and is
            highly extensible. The S language is often the vehicle of choice for
            research in statistical methodology, and R provides an Open Source
            route to participation in that activity.<br /><br />

            One of R’s strengths is the ease with which well-designed
            publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical
            symbols and formulae where needed. Great care has been taken over
            the defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user
            retains full control.<br /><br />

            R is available as Free Software under the terms of the Free Software
            Foundation’s GNU General Public License in source code form. It
            compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms and similar
            systems (including FreeBSD and Linux), Windows and MacOS.<br /><br />

            TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by
            Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and
            adds optional static typing to the language. It is designed for the
            development of large applications and transpiles to JavaScript. As
            it is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are
            also valid TypeScript programs.<br /><br />

            TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for both
            client-side and server-side execution (as with Node.js or Deno).
            Multiple options are available for transpilation. The default
            TypeScript Compiler can be used, or the Babel compiler can be
            invoked to convert TypeScript to JavaScript.<br /><br />

            TypeScript supports definition files that can contain type
            information of existing JavaScript libraries, much like C++ header
            files can describe the structure of existing object files. This
            enables other programs to use the values defined in the files as if
            they were statically typed TypeScript entities. There are
            third-party header files for popular libraries such as jQuery,
            MongoDB, and D3.js. TypeScript headers for the Node.js basic modules
            are also available, allowing development of Node.js programs within
            TypeScript.<br /><br />

            The TypeScript compiler is itself written in TypeScript and compiled
            to JavaScript. It is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.
            TypeScript is included as a first-class programming language in
            Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Update 2 and later, alongside C# and
            other Microsoft languages. An official extension also allows Visual
            Studio 2012 to support TypeScript. Anders Hejlsberg, lead architect
            of C# and creator of Delphi and Turbo Pascal, has worked on the
            development of TypeScript.

          <h3>Objective-C</h3>
          <p>
            Objective-C is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming
            language that adds Smalltalk-style messaging to the C programming
            language. Originally developed by Brad Cox and Tom Love in the early
            1980s, it was selected by NeXT for its NeXTSTEP operating system.
            Objective-C was the standard programming language supported by Apple
            for developing macOS (which descended from NeXTSTEP) and iOS
            applications using their respective application programming
            interfaces (APIs), Cocoa and Cocoa Touch, until the introduction of
            Swift in 2014.<br /><br />

            Objective-C programs developed for non-Apple operating systems or
            that are not dependent on Apple's APIs may also be compiled for any
            platform supported by GNU GCC or LLVM/Clang.<br /><br />

            Objective-C source code 'messaging/implementation' program files
            usually have .m filename extensions, while Objective-C
            'header/interface' files have .h extensions, the same as C header
            files. Objective-C++ files are denoted with a .mm file extension.<br /><br />

            Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming
            language developed by Apple Inc. and the open-source community.
            First released in 2014, Swift was developed as a replacement for
            Apple's earlier programming language Objective-C, as Objective-C had
            been largely unchanged since the early 1980s and lacked modern
            language features. Swift works with Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa Touch
            frameworks, and a key aspect of Swift's design was the ability to
            interoperate with the huge body of existing Objective-C code
            developed for Apple products over the previous decades. It was built
            with the open source LLVM compiler framework and has been included
            in Xcode since version 6, released in 2014. On Apple platforms, it
            uses the Objective-C runtime library, which allows C, Objective-C,
            C++ and Swift code to run within one program.<br /><br />

            Apple intended Swift to support many core concepts associated with
            Objective-C, notably dynamic dispatch, widespread late binding,
            extensible programming and similar features, but in a "safer" way,
            making it easier to catch software bugs; Swift has features
            addressing some common programming errors like null pointer
            dereferencing and provides syntactic sugar to help avoid the pyramid
            of doom. Swift supports the concept of protocol extensibility, an
            extensibility system that can be applied to types, structs and
            classes, which Apple promotes as a real change in programming
            paradigms they term "protocol-oriented programming" (similar to
            traits).<br /><br />
